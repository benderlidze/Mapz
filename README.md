# Mapz
**Description**
Mapz is a decentralized map-based game that aims to revolutionize the way we navigate and interact with the world. With a focus on community-driven ownership and collaboration, Mapz allows users to own parts of the map as NFT land parcels and earn rewards for reporting traffic incidents and contributing to the platform.

**Features**
1. Ownership of NFT land parcels: Users can own and trade parts of the map as NFTs, providing a sense of ownership.
2. Community rewards: Users are incentivized to report traffic incidents, road closures, and other travel-related information, earning rewards in the platform's native currency, MAPZ.
3. Decentralized governance: The direction and development of the platform are driven by the community of token holders, ensuring a fair and transparent decision-making process.
4. Advertising opportunities: Land parcel owners can collaborate with advertisers and partners to monetize their properties, creating a thriving ecosystem within the app.
